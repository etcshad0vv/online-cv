        tagline: |
          I took the initiative and created the first wireless backbone network in the City of Lamia, while i was doing my BSc studies. University personnel agreed to invest on this initiative, and joined us.
          We managed to expand the network coverage in the city centre using omnidirectional antennas and wireless access points owned by the active participants of the network backbone.
          At the same time, we achieved on presenting University IT services(such as e-class, digital library) without the necessity to be an owner of Internet line once you are at home, as long as you are using your laptop 
          close to scattered WAPs in the city.
